			<h2> 1. Some boxes in a row. </h2>
			<p> Here’s a bunch of boxes floated next to each other with numbers in the middle, but two of them are special. </p>

			<div id="gray">B</div>
			<div id="orange">L</div>
			<div id="gray">O</div>
			<div id="gray">C</div>
			<div id="orange">K</div>

			<h2> 2. This is a photo of a cat. </h2>

			<p>Drop an image of a cat here that fills the width of this column. You’ll probably have to use something like <span> width: 100%; </span> . And for that little guy, you’ll have to use something like <span> font-family: monospace;</span> .</p>

			<h2> 3. This is a big link. </h2>

			<p> When you hover over it, it changes color. When you click it, it opens up Google in another tab. You don’t need to use a <span>div</span> for this. An a tag is an inline element, but you can make it a block element with css. </p>
